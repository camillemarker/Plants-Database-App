#### **_Description_**

'My Garden' is a plant-tracking app that allows the user to log key information about the greenery in their gardens. Users who have created an account can add plants to their personal 'My Garden' page, where they can then view specific information about the plant such as type (flower, veggie, fruit, herb, shrub), date planted, and sunshine/water requirements. Users will be able to leave dated comments about the plants in their garden regarding their progress and observations about its growth, as well as keep a log of when the plant was last watered. Comments can only be made and deleted by the authorized posting user.
